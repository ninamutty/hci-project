I click and theres no visual feedback. I check and the song was not liked and the plaulist was not deleted. Sometimes it marks songs as ""liked"" and I never liked it before. This is stupid. Sometimes I just want to park and listen to music and want to use those features at the same time and I can't for no apparent reason. Please fix it. It's frustrating and also makes me feel crazy bc I thought I liked a song or added to a playlist and turns out it just never went through. Or I hit add to playlist and it actually does do it, BUT gives me no visual feedback or confirmation, doesn't ask me ""this song is already in the playlist"", nothing.  So yeah, great app but some features don't work in my car.

Also I HATE that you made the Library tab include everything and I have to hit ""Playlist"" to filter my library to just playlists. Why are you putting in an extra step for no reason. It doesn't make any sense to clog the list up with artists I liked. You can like like hundreds of artists and I simply do not have that many playlists.

But I‚Äôm not normal and i like to make loads if playlists and then i need to delete them. I think a really good feature you could add to this app is a delete button on the playlists tab. It would help with being able to select a mass number of playlists to easily delete. It would also be good to have a similar feature with adding songs. If there were a button that allowed you to add the same song to multiple playlists at once, instead of having to go through each playlist and add the song individually. Also, it would be good if in a playlist you could organize where each song goes like if you want to organize it alphabetically or something on mobile. Finally, it would be nice if you could add a way to view the amount of streams an album has, or make it easier to see. A group of people including me are trying to get an album to a certain number of streams, and I can‚Äôt view the number, although i think other people can, so if you could make the streams a bit easier to access that would be nice.

My complaints are that there is a bug that just stops your music even when your internet connection is great. It often happens when your phone screen is locked, and sometimes when you open your phone and go to the app it has completely crashed, other times it has just paused it for some reason.
 My other complaint is more trivial, and it is about the auto play of recommended songs. I understand that the app is designed to act like a radio station, where you can‚Äôt really choose which songs you play and some will be played that are relating to the genre. However, I just really hate this feature, especially when I am playing songs from a artist that I really like however it is in a genre that I generally hate. Ideally the recommend song would be close enough to the artist‚Äôs style that the user might like the song as well even though they don‚Äôt like the genre, however that hasn‚Äôt been the case yet for me.

4,2020-01-16 00:27:00,False,4,This app used to be the highest of my phone but with every update the layout of the app gets worse and worse. The current layout of just playlist is so inconvenient as opposed to the previous one where it would have your most recently played music laid out. The moving of the settings to the home screen makes changing the EQ and sound quality such a burden in comparison to what it was. Also I used to be able to go under the artist tab and even able to listen to all the songs I have saved from the artist specifically but now if I go I see ALL of the songs instead of the the saved despite being able to do that before. These last few updates have been rather reductive and if they continue to degrade I WILL find another app to use for my music. I highly recommend the company roll back some of its cosmetic changes to the app because they ARENT good changes. And also return some of the practical functions the app used to have like being able to listen and shuffle to specific saved song by artist instead of having to make an entire playlist just to be able to listen To one artist or one album.,Why not higher?,Cmbsax5917Starwarsfan,tab

I used to love the app because you could actually see your saved songs from specific artists, but now going my library>artists>clicking on an artist only brings you to the artist homepage instead of the specific songs you liked, which is pointless if I‚Äôve only liked three songs from an artist.

Hates:  the constant in-your-face ‚Äúpopular‚Äù today‚Äôs hits.  Mostly genres I care nothing about. How about showing me selections from my library??

It‚Äôs only presented from newest to oldest. That‚Äôs dumb. If that was sortable by date, it would be super nice for those of us who like music to be album-oriented. -1 star.
